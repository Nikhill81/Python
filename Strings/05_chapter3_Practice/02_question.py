# Write a program to detect double space in a string

# name = "John is a good boy  "

# print(name.find("  "))

# If response is -1 it means their is no double space if another value is come it means their is an error


#------------------------------------------

# Replace the double spaces from problem 3 with single spaces


name = "John is a  good boy   "

print(name.replace("  ", "  "))
print(name)
